When your baby is showing signs of readiness for solid foods, begin with foods that are rich in iron. Well cooked meat, meat alternatives, and iron fortified infant cereal are rich in iron. Please see the booklet titled Feeding your Baby at https:// resources.beststart.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/D12-E.pdf. If you wish to talk with someone about feeding solids, here are some options: \u2022 Telehealth Ontario to discuss introducing solids with a dietitian at 1-866-797-0000. \u2022 Unlock Food at http://www.unlockfood.ca/. \u2022 Your local health department or contact ServiceOntario INFOline at 1-866-532-3161 or www.health.gov.on.ca/en/common/system/services/ phu/locations.aspx. \u2022 Your local health department or contact ServiceOntario INFOline at 1-866-532-3161 When can I give my baby cow\u2019s milk? If you continue to breastfeed, introducing cow\u2019s milk is optional. If you do choose to introduce cow\u2019s milk, wait until your baby is 9 to 12 months old and offer it in an open cup. Offer pasteurized whole (3.25%) cow\u2019s (or goat\u2019s) milk so your baby gets the extra calories and fat for their brain development. Skim, 1% and 2% milk are not recommended before 2 years of age since they do not have the extra calories and fat for your baby\u2019s brain",

Some parents find it helpful to practice breastfeeding in front of their partner or a close friend or a mirror before breastfeeding in a public place. When should I feed my baby more than breast milk? Breastfeed your baby and give vitamin D drops for the first 6 months. Watch your baby for signs of readiness to begin other foods around 6 months of age. Babies who are ready to begin complementary foods are able to: \u2022 Hold their head up steadily. \u2022 Sit up and lean forward. \u2022 Open their mouth when food is offered. \u2022 Use their thumb and their finger to pick up food. \u2022 Let you know when they are full and they no longer want food. Talk to your health care provider or a skilled professional such as a registered dietitian or public health nurse if you are thinking of beginning solids a little earlier or later than when your baby is 6 months old. Continue to breastfeed up to age of 2 years and beyond. Breastfeeding and breast milk provide your baby with important nutrients and immune protection even when your baby is receiving other foods as well.

Breastfeeding Matters 1 S E C T I O N 1 The Importance of Breastfeeding Breastfeeding is important for you and your baby. The term breastfeeding/breast milk is also known as chestfeeding/chest milk and can be used interchangeably. Breast milk has over 200 known ingredients and is the healthiest food for your baby. It also protects your baby from infection and has special components to help your baby grow and develop. Your baby needs only breast milk for the first 6 months. At 6 months, start solid foods and continue to breastfeed for up to 2 years and beyond. Breastfeeding matters because: \u2022 Everyone benefits from breastfeeding: you, your baby, your family and your community. \u2022 Breast milk is convenient, always the right temperature and available anytime. \u2022 Breastfeeding is free. \u2022 Breastfeeding promotes bonding between you and your baby. \u2022 Breastfeeding is environmentally friendly. \u2022 Breastfeeding reduces health care costs for your family and society.
